    "text": "The Computer Science Department of the University of Crete operates since 1984, historically the second Computer Science Department to operate in Greece. The Computer Science Department belongs to the School of Sciences and Engineering, which operates in Heraklion. The School was founded as School of Physical & Mathematical Sciences in 1973 and renamed as the School of Science in 1984. The Department of Computer Sciences was established in 1983. In FEK 388 / 5.7.83 was conversion and distribution of vacancies at the University of Crete and was first given to the Department of Computer Science 13 faculty positions.  The graduate program of the Department began operating in 1985 as \"Master Program in Computer Science\". In 1992 all postgraduate studies in Greece were organized under N2083 / 1992 (FEK159 / A / 21.09.1992) Chapter V \"Graduate Studies\" which replaced Article 81 of Law 1566/1985 and was based on Postgraduate Studies Regulation of the Department, on the proposal of the Department to the Ministry of Education for the modernization of postgraduate studies in Greece.

The Department gradually staffed by excellent scientists. The Computer Science Department elected the first faculty in 1981 and became operational in 1984 so accepted and the first undergraduates. In February 1985 the postgraduate program was established. Today the department has twenty-one (21) Professors and regularly hosts academic scholars as visiting faculty professors.  At thirty-five (35) years of operation has developed and implemented a modern curriculum. Today, a significant contribution to higher education in our country in science and computer technology issues are recognized by educational work at the undergraduate and graduate level, with quality acclaimed internationally.  The Department even since its establishment, had a strong research orientation. Since the inception of the Department works closely with the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH). This cooperation, which continues today, creates an excellent environment for research and education. The research of the Department now enjoys international recognition. Members of the Department throughout the history of the Department and even more today, hold important international collaborations with leading academic and research institutions and also with industry in areas of crucial interest.  The Department is recognized today as one of the top departments in computer science in the country.  Based on a recent study of the work of the Departments of Computer Engineering and Computer Science of  the country based on bibliographical indices, the Department of Computer Science was ranked first among all departments.",

The Architecture elements of Venetian and Ottoman era of this famous building have been restored and renovated with respect by the owners in collaboration with the local archaeological department. Over the years, the nations and the cultures that passed from Crete are reflected in the most vivid way through buildings that have survived to our days. One of those buildings – with the most elegant architectural elements in Heraklion, is the two-storey house located in the historic city center on the corner of the streets Nikou Kazantzakis & 1770 which is transformed in to a beautiful Boutique Hotel. The history of the building begins the period of the Venetian occupation around 1510 and completed by adding one floor during the period of Ottoman occupation in 1730, in order to house senior officers. The main building was the residence of the first Aga of Heraklion and the building in the courtyard was his stable. In the courtyard there was a tower and from that point they could protect the Aga. In the basement were the baths of the house. The groundfloor is said to be the room where the stableman lived. The first floor was the Aga’s space where was his room and the room that accommodated his wives. The building is classified as historical monument and a work of art by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Public Works. The Venetian and Ottoman elements of this charming building have been restored carefully, honoring the heritage of the building in collaboration with the local archaeological service. The building is a typical example of Venetian and Ottoman architecture and is set with a wooden roof. The use of wood characterizes the architecture and the morphological composition. The windows have a wooden frame and thin molding, while wooden jambs protrude slightly at the corners of the enclosed balconies. At the end of the structure there is a complex and wide wooden molding. The building is organized in two wings that form the letter Γ of the Greek alphabet with each other and define a large internal courtyard. Here was a meeting place for nobles and lords who were discussing various issues as economical, commercial, political that concerned the city, or they passed their free time. It was something like a combination of a chamber and a club. For this reason the building had five hidden exits in case of an emergency. After the renovation the building accommodates 4 superior double rooms and 2 double floor family apartments. On the ground floor that is connected with the courtyard there is the Café & Wine bar that will offer Cretan diet breakfast. On the basement operates the Spa Center where the Ottoman culture re-experience which already exists 1 N.

    "text": "An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against      bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections. Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.      A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity.      Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics. Sometimes, the term antibiotic which means opposing life, based on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: against and (βίος-) biotic: life, is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. However, both classes have the same goal of      killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy.      Antibacterials include antiseptic drugs, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants,      whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine      and sometimes in livestock feed. Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. However, their effectiveness and easy access have also led to their overuse, and some bacteria have developed resistance.      This has led to widespread problems, and the World Health Organization have classified antimicrobial resistance as a serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future,      it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age,      in any country.",

The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.         Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

    "text": "London (/ˈlʌndən/ (About this soundlisten) LUN-dən) is the capital and largest city of      England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in southeastern England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits. The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's most powerful, most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, innovative, sustainable, most investment friendly, most popular for work, and the most vegetarian friendly city in the world. London exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation. London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic performance. It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP. It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic. It is the leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games. London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated mid-2016 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,787,892, the most populous of any city in the European Union and accounting for 13.4% of the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The population within the London commuter belt is the most populous in the EU with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016. London was the world's most populous city from c. 1831 to 1925. London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and Greenwich Mean Time. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London has numerous museums, galleries, libraries and sporting events. These include the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.",

    "text": "Malaysia (/məˈleɪziə, -ʒə/ (About this soundlisten) mə-LAY-zee-ə, -⁠zhə; Malay: [məlejsiə])      is a country in Southeast Asia.          The federal constitutional monarchy consists of 13 states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand in the north and maritime borders          with Singapore in the south, Vietnam in the northeast, and Indonesia in the west. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a         maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital and largest city while Putrajaya is the seat of federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the world's 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. In the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, with large numbers of endemic species.          Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire when the Straits Settlements became British protectorates. Peninsular Malaysia was unified as the Malayan Union in 1946.      Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation.         The population is concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia, where 20 million out of approximately 30 million Malaysians live.  70 per cent of the population is urban. Kuala Lumpur is the capital and the largest city in Malaysia, as well as its main commercial and financial centre.  Putrajaya, a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government, as many executive and  judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur. A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia since its independence from the United Kingdom with its GDP growing at an average of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years.  The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects  were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya.       The constitution grants freedom of religion and makes Malaysia an officially secular state, while establishing Islam as the \"religion of the Federation\".  According to the Population and Housing Census 2010 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. 0.7% declared no religion and the remaining 1.4% practised other religions or did not provide any information. Sunni Islam of Shafi'i school of jurisprudence is the dominant branch of Islam in Malaysia, while 18% are nondenominational Muslims.",

These three film festivals are internationally acclaimed, and give creators the artistic freedom to express themselves through film.  Founded in Venice, Italy, in August 1932, the festival is part of the Venice Biennale, an exhibition of Italian art founded by the Venice City Council on 19 April 1893. The Venice Biennale, founded in 1893, is situated within the cultural sphere, covering work ranging from art, architecture, dance, music and theatre to cinema (the world-known Venice Film Festival). Today, the Biennale includes a range of separate events including: the International Art Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Music; the International Theatre Festival; the International Architecture Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Dance; the International Kids' Carnival; and the annual Venice Film Festival, which is arguably the best-known of all the events.  The festival in held annually in late August or early September on the island of the Lido in the Venice Lagoon. Screenings take place in the historic Palazzo del Cinema on the Lungomare Marconi. Since its inception the Venice Film Festival has grown into one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, and it is still one of the most popular and fast-growing.  The 76th Venice International Film Festival is scheduled to be held from 28 August to 7 September 2019. The President of the Venice Biennale represents the festival in front of its financial partner, the public authorities and the media. He is chosen by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. The current President is Paolo Baratta, appointed in 2008, who has previously held the position between 1998 and 2002.  The Director is responsible for the coordination of the events and is chosen by the President of the Venice Biennale and its delegates.

    "text": "The Venice Film Festival or Venice International Film Festival (Italian: Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia, \"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the Venice Biennale\") is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the \"Big Three\" film festivals, alongside the Cannes Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival. These three film festivals are internationally acclaimed, and give creators the artistic freedom to express themselves through film.  Founded in Venice, Italy, in August 1932, the festival is part of the Venice Biennale, an exhibition of Italian art founded by the Venice City Council on 19 April 1893. The Venice Biennale, founded in 1893, is situated within the cultural sphere, covering work ranging from art, architecture, dance, music and theatre to cinema (the world-known Venice Film Festival). Today, the Biennale includes a range of separate events including: the International Art Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Music; the International Theatre Festival; the International Architecture Exhibition; the International Festival of Contemporary Dance; the International Kids' Carnival; and the annual Venice Film Festival, which is arguably the best-known of all the events.  The festival in held annually in late August or early September on the island of the Lido in the Venice Lagoon. Screenings take place in the historic Palazzo del Cinema on the Lungomare Marconi. Since its inception the Venice Film Festival has grown into one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, and it is still one of the most popular and fast-growing.  The 76th Venice International Film Festival is scheduled to be held from 28 August to 7 September 2019. The President of the Venice Biennale represents the festival in front of its financial partner, the public authorities and the media. He is chosen by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. The current President is Paolo Baratta, appointed in 2008, who has previously held the position between 1998 and 2002.  The Director is responsible for the coordination of the events and is chosen by the President of the Venice Biennale and its delegates. The current Director is Alberto Barbera, appointed in 2012, who has previously held the position between 1999 and 2002. His current term will end in 2020.",

    "title": "Usual suspects",
    "text": "The Usual Suspects is a 1995 neo-noir mystery film directed and co-produced      by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.               It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite,      and Kevin Spacey.  The film was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival,      and then initially released in a few theaters. It received favorable reviews and was eventually given a wider release.      McQuarrie won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Spacey won the Academy Award for Best      Supporting Actor for his performance. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film as having the      35th greatest screenplay of all time.              A criminal, Dean Keaton, is lying badly wounded on a ship docked in San Pedro Bay.      He is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls \"Keyser\",      who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police       recover twenty-seven bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash,       a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint,       a con artist with cerebral palsy. U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies from New York City to interrogate Verbal.       The events that led Keaton, Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, Todd Hockney, and Verbal onto the ship are then       described by Verbal via flashback.  Six weeks earlier in New York, Verbal and the other four criminals       were arrested as suspects in a truck-hijacking,        only to be released thanks to Edie Finneran, Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. T       hey then decided to pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Led by Keaton, they robbed        a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops,        netting millions in emeralds and getting over fifty cops arrested.        They then went to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot,        who connects them with another jewel heist. The heist goes badly, and the men learn that the job was        arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi. They meet Kobayashi, who says he arranged for their arrests in New York and that        his employer, Keyser Söze—a mysterious Turkish crime lord whom each of the men have unwittingly stolen from—has ordered them to raid a ship manned by Argentinian drug dealers and destroy $91 million worth        of cocaine being sold on board. Their reward will be the cash brought for the exchange, and being freed         from Söze's influence.  During Kovash's interrogation, it is learned that there was no cocaine         on the ship and that Söze was seen on board. Verbal then tells Kujan a legend about Söze: that he had murdered         his own family when they were being held hostage by Hungarian mobsters, and then massacred the mobsters and their         families before disappearing, doing business only through underlings who did not know who they were working for.          Söze thus became a fearsome urban myth, \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night\".  Concluding his story, Verbal reveals Fenster was killed trying to flee; the men then threatened Kobayashi, only to accept the assignment when he threatened their loved ones. The men attack the ship during the night, killing several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering there is no cocaine.          Hockney, a prisoner in one of the cabins, McManus, and then Keaton are killed by an unseen assailant,          who sets fire to the ship as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock.  Kujan deduces that Keaton must be Söze,          as the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming           he could identify Söze. Marquez was being represented by Edie Finneran,            who has also been recently murdered. Kujan claims that the Argentinians took Marquez to sell            him to Söze's Hungarian rivals; Keaton then used the assault so that he could kill Marquez            personally and fake his own death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton had been behind everything,            but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bail is posted and he is released.  Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal had been lying, piecing together details for his story from items posted on a crowded bulletin board in the office, and the \"Kobayashi\" brand on the bottom of the coffee mug Kujan was drinking from.            Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing            his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives from the hospital where Kovash has finally provided a facial composite of Söze, which looks exactly like Verbal. Kujan misses Verbal by moments as the latter disappears into a car driven by \"Kobayashi\".",

    "title": "Bloody Sunday",
    "text": "A former British soldier will stand trial for firing on civil rights protesters in Northern Ireland in 1972,      an event that came to be known as Bloody Sunday,               prosecutors said. But 16 other ex-paratroopers and and two former members of the Official IRA (Irish Republican Army)      will face no action. The army veteran, known as Soldier F, has been charged with the murder       of demonstrators James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murders of  four other men,        the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland said Thursday. Bloody Sunday was one of the darkest        episodes in Northern Ireland's Troubles.  On 30 January 1972 troops fired on unarmed protesters in a civil rights        march in Derry, also known as Londonderry, killing 13 people and wounding 15. One injured man died four months later.         The families of the victims have campaigned for decades for the former soldiers to face justice. Relatives were visibly upset following the announcement of the decision. Solicitor Ciaran Shiels, a solicitor for a number of them, said they were \"disappointed that not all of those responsible are to face trial.\" The impact of the killings was an  immediate accelerant for the violence that  would claim 3,500 lives in the 25 years to the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998, McCann said. The victims' families were stunned by the events of the day, not just at the loss of their loved ones but by the army's claims that the people in the crowds fired the first shot. The soldiers maintained they were acting under order, returning fire on what they believed to be hostile armed attackers. A short internal military inquiry shortly after Bloody Sunday, known as the Widgery Report, concluded the soldiers had done nothing wrong. And for many years that was the accepted government narrative. Saville Inquiry Over time, though, the victims' families got organized, campaigned for justice and eventually, more than 25 years after the killings, when a peace deal was signed in Northern Ireland,  the British government committed to a full-scale inquiry.  Headed by Lord Saville, the inquiry lasted 12 years, with 435 days of oral evidence alone. It involved more than 2,000 witnesses, with an estimated 125,000 pages of evidential material considered. It cost a quarter of a billion dollars and its conclusions, announced by British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010, brought cheers from the people of Derry, in particular the victims' families.",

    "text": "Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ, is an American former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\" Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. He is currently the principal owner and chairman of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"three-peat\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season, and started a new career in Minor League Baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.\",      Jordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine Mickael. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\". It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $209 million in 2018), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.  In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, to build a 56,000 square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in 2012. His two sons attended Loyola Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school located in Wilmette, Illinois. Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the University of Illinois. After two seasons, Jeffrey left the Illinois basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third season, then received a release to transfer to the University of Central Florida, where Marcus was attending. Marcus transferred to Whitney Young High School after his sophomore year at Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009, and played three seasons of basketball for the school. Jordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played Division I basketball at UNC Greensboro.  On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991.  A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.  He proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.",

At thirty-five (35) years of operation has developed and implemented a modern curriculum. Today, a significant contribution to higher education in our country in science and computer technology issues are recognized by educational work at the undergraduate and graduate level, with quality acclaimed internationally.  The Department even since its establishment, had a strong research orientation. Since the inception of the Department works closely with the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH). This cooperation, which continues today, creates an excellent environment for research and education. The research of the Department now enjoys international recognition. Members of the Department throughout the history of the Department and even more today, hold important international collaborations with leading academic and research institutions and also with industry in areas of crucial interest.  The Department is recognized today as one of the top departments in computer science in the country.  Based on a recent study of the work of the Departments of Computer Engineering and Computer Science of  the country based on bibliographical indices, the Department of Computer Science was ranked first among all departments.",

The Architecture elements of Venetian and Ottoman era of this famous building have been restored and renovated with respect by the owners in collaboration with the local archaeological department. Over the years, the nations and the cultures that passed from Crete are reflected in the most vivid way through buildings that have survived to our days. One of those buildings – with the most elegant architectural elements in Heraklion, is the two-storey house located in the historic city center on the corner of the streets Nikou Kazantzakis & 1770 which is transformed in to a beautiful Boutique Hotel. The history of the building begins the period of the Venetian occupation around 1510 and completed by adding one floor during the period of Ottoman occupation in 1730,      in order to house senior officers. The main building was the residence of the first Aga of Heraklion      and the building in the courtyard was his stable. In the courtyard there was a tower and from that      point they could protect the Aga. In the basement were the baths of the house. The groundfloor      is said to be the room where the stableman lived.      The first floor was the Aga’s space where was his room and the room that accommodated his wives.      The building is classified as historical monument and a work of art by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry      of Public Works. The Venetian and Ottoman elements of this charming building have been restored carefully,      honoring the heritage of the building in collaboration with the local archaeological service.       The building is a typical example of Venetian and Ottoman architecture and is set with a wooden roof.       The use of wood characterizes the architecture and the morphological composition. The windows have a wooden       frame and thin molding, while wooden jambs protrude slightly at the corners of the enclosed balconies.       At the end of the structure there is a complex and wide wooden molding. The building is organized in       two wings that form the letter Γ of the Greek alphabet with each other and define a large internal courtyard.       Here was a meeting place for nobles and lords who were discussing various issues as economical, commercial, political that concerned the city, or they passed their free time. It was something like a combination of a       chamber and a club. For this reason the building had five hidden exits in case of an emergency.       After the renovation the building accommodates 4 superior double rooms and 2 double floor family apartments.       On the ground floor that is connected with the courtyard there is the Café & Wine bar that will offer Cretan diet breakfast.

    "text": "Malaysia (/məˈleɪziə, -ʒə/ (About this soundlisten) mə-LAY-zee-ə, -⁠zhə; Malay: [məlejsiə])      is a country in Southeast Asia.          The federal constitutional monarchy consists of 13 states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand in the north and maritime borders          with Singapore in the south, Vietnam in the northeast, and Indonesia in the west. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a         maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital and largest city while Putrajaya is the seat of federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the world's 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. In the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, with large numbers of endemic species.          Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire when the Straits Settlements became British protectorates. Peninsular Malaysia was unified as the Malayan Union in 1946.      Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948, and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation.         The population is concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia, where 20 million out of approximately 30 million Malaysians live.  70 per cent of the population is urban. Kuala Lumpur is the capital and the largest city in Malaysia, as well as its main commercial and financial centre.  Putrajaya, a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government, as many executive and  judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur. A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia since its independence from the United Kingdom with its GDP growing at an average of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years.  The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects  were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya.       The constitution grants freedom of religion and makes Malaysia an officially secular state, while establishing Islam as the \"religion of the Federation\".  According to the Population and Housing Census 2010 figures, ethnicity and religious beliefs correlate highly. Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. 0.7% declared no religion and the remaining 1.4% practised other religions or did not provide any information. Sunni Islam of Shafi'i school of jurisprudence is the dominant branch of Islam in Malaysia, while 18% are nondenominational Muslims.",

    "text": "An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against      bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections. Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. They may either kill or      inhibit the growth of bacteria.      A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity.      Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses      are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics. Sometimes, the term antibiotic which means opposing life,      based on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: against and (βίος-) biotic: life, is broadly used to refer to any substance       used against microbes, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally       (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. However, both classes have the same goal of      killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy.      Antibacterials include antiseptic drugs, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants,      whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine      and sometimes in livestock feed. Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century.  However, their effectiveness and easy access have also led to their overuse, and some bacteria have developed resistance. This has led to widespread problems, and the World Health Organization      have classified antimicrobial resistance as a serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age,      in any country.",

    "text": "The Usual Suspects is a 1995 neo-noir mystery film directed and co-produced      by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.               It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite,      and Kevin Spacey.  The film was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival,      and then initially released in a few theaters. It received favorable reviews and was eventually given a wider release.      McQuarrie won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Spacey won the Academy Award for Best      Supporting Actor for his performance. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film as having the      35th greatest screenplay of all time.              A criminal, Dean Keaton, is lying badly wounded on a ship docked in San Pedro Bay.      He is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls \"Keyser\",      who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police       recover twenty-seven bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash,       a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint,       a con artist with cerebral palsy. U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies from New York City to interrogate Verbal.       The events that led Keaton, Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, Todd Hockney, and Verbal onto the ship are then       described by Verbal via flashback.  Six weeks earlier in New York, Verbal and the other four criminals       were arrested as suspects in a truck-hijacking,        only to be released thanks to Edie Finneran, Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. T       hey then decided to pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Led by Keaton, they robbed        a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops,        netting millions in emeralds and getting over fifty cops arrested.        They then went to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot,        who connects them with another jewel heist. The heist goes badly, and the men learn that the job was        arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi. They meet Kobayashi, who says he arranged for their arrests in New York and that        his employer, Keyser Söze—a mysterious Turkish crime lord whom each of the men have unwittingly stolen from—has ordered them to raid a ship manned by Argentinian drug dealers and destroy $91 million worth        of cocaine being sold on board. Their reward will be the cash brought for the exchange, and being freed         from Söze's influence.  During Kovash's interrogation, it is learned that there was no cocaine         on the ship and that Söze was seen on board. Verbal then tells Kujan a legend about Söze: that he had murdered         his own family when they were being held hostage by Hungarian mobsters, and then massacred the mobsters and their         families before disappearing, doing business only through underlings who did not know who they were working for.          Söze thus became a fearsome urban myth, \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night\".  Concluding his story, Verbal reveals Fenster was killed trying to flee; the men then threatened Kobayashi, only to accept the assignment when he threatened their loved ones. The men attack the ship during the night, killing several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering there is no cocaine.          Hockney, a prisoner in one of the cabins, McManus, and then Keaton are killed by an unseen assailant,          who sets fire to the ship as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock.  Kujan deduces that Keaton must be Söze,          as the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming           he could identify Söze. Marquez was being represented by Edie Finneran,            who has also been recently murdered. Kujan claims that the Argentinians took Marquez to sell            him to Söze's Hungarian rivals; Keaton then used the assault so that he could kill Marquez            personally and fake his own death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton had been behind everything,            but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bail is posted and he is released.  Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal had been lying, piecing together details for his story from items posted on a crowded bulletin board in the office, and the \"Kobayashi\" brand on the bottom of the coffee mug Kujan was drinking from.            Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing            his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives from the hospital where Kovash has finally provided a facial composite of Söze, which looks exactly like Verbal. Kujan misses Verbal by moments as the latter disappears into a car driven by \"Kobayashi\".",

    "text": "Veneziano Boutique Hotel is in a historic landmark building, in one of the most elegant architectural buildings of the city of Heraklion, has a beautiful interior courtyard and includes all the modern luxuries. The Architecture elements of Venetian and Ottoman era of this famous building have been restored and renovated with respect by the owners in collaboration with the local archaeological department. Over the years, the nations and the cultures that passed from Crete are reflected in the most vivid way through buildings that have survived to our days. One of those buildings – with the most elegant architectural elements in Heraklion, is the two-storey house located in the historic city center on the corner of the streets Nikou Kazantzakis & 1770 which is transformed in to a beautiful Boutique Hotel. The history of the building begins the period of the Venetian occupation around 1510 and completed by adding one floor during the period of Ottoman occupation in 1730,      in order to house senior officers. The main building was the residence of the first Aga of Heraklion      and the building in the courtyard was his stable. In the courtyard there was a tower and from that      point they could protect the Aga. In the basement were the baths of the house. The groundfloor      is said to be the room where the stableman lived.      The first floor was the Aga’s space where was his room and the room that accommodated his wives.      The building is classified as historical monument and a work of art by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry      of Public Works. The Venetian and Ottoman elements of this charming building have been restored carefully,      honoring the heritage of the building in collaboration with the local archaeological service.       The building is a typical example of Venetian and Ottoman architecture and is set with a wooden roof.       The use of wood characterizes the architecture and the morphological composition. The windows have a wooden       frame and thin molding, while wooden jambs protrude slightly at the corners of the enclosed balconies.       At the end of the structure there is a complex and wide wooden molding. The building is organized in       two wings that form the letter Γ of the Greek alphabet with each other and define a large internal courtyard.       Here was a meeting place for nobles and lords who were discussing various issues as economical, commercial, political that concerned the city, or they passed their free time. It was something like a combination of a       chamber and a club. For this reason the building had five hidden exits in case of an emergency.       After the renovation the building accommodates 4 superior double rooms and 2 double floor family apartments.       On the ground floor that is connected with the courtyard there is the Café & Wine bar that will offer Cretan diet breakfast.       On the basement operates the Spa Center where the Ottoman culture re-experience which already exists 1 N.

    "text": "An antibiotic is a type of antimicrobial substance active against      bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections. Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. They may either kill or      inhibit the growth of bacteria.      A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity.      Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses      are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics. Sometimes, the term antibiotic which means opposing life,      based on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: against and (βίος-) biotic: life, is broadly used to refer to any substance       used against microbes, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally       (by one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. However, both classes have the same goal of      killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy.      Antibacterials include antiseptic drugs, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants,      whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine      and sometimes in livestock feed. Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century.      However, their effectiveness and easy access have also led to their overuse, and some bacteria have developed resistance.      This has led to widespread problems, and the World Health Organization      have classified antimicrobial resistance as a serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future,      it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age,      in any country.",

It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a       whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.         Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.          Most accounts of the origin of tiramisu date its invention to the 1960s in the region of Veneto,          Italy, at the restaurant 'Le Beccherie' in Treviso.

It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite,      and Kevin Spacey.  The film was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival,      and then initially released in a few theaters. It received favorable reviews and was eventually given a wider release.      McQuarrie won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Spacey won the Academy Award for Best      Supporting Actor for his performance. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film as having the      35th greatest screenplay of all time.              A criminal, Dean Keaton, is lying badly wounded on a ship docked in San Pedro Bay.      He is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls \"Keyser\",      who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police       recover twenty-seven bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash,       a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint,       a con artist with cerebral palsy. U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies from New York City to interrogate Verbal.       The events that led Keaton, Michael McManus, Fred Fenster, Todd Hockney, and Verbal onto the ship are then       described by Verbal via flashback.  Six weeks earlier in New York, Verbal and the other four criminals       were arrested as suspects in a truck-hijacking,        only to be released thanks to Edie Finneran, Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. T       hey then decided to pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Led by Keaton, they robbed        a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops,        netting millions in emeralds and getting over fifty cops arrested.        They then went to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot,        who connects them with another jewel heist. The heist goes badly, and the men learn that the job was        arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi. They meet Kobayashi, who says he arranged for their arrests in New York and that        his employer, Keyser Söze—a mysterious Turkish crime lord whom each of the men have unwittingly stolen from—has ordered them to raid a ship manned by Argentinian drug dealers and destroy $91 million worth        of cocaine being sold on board. Their reward will be the cash brought for the exchange, and being freed         from Söze's influence.  During Kovash's interrogation, it is learned that there was no cocaine         on the ship and that Söze was seen on board. Verbal then tells Kujan a legend about Söze: that he had murdered         his own family when they were being held hostage by Hungarian mobsters, and then massacred the mobsters and their         families before disappearing, doing business only through underlings who did not know who they were working for.          Söze thus became a fearsome urban myth, \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night\".  Concluding his story, Verbal reveals Fenster was killed trying to flee; the men then threatened Kobayashi, only to accept the assignment when he threatened their loved ones. The men attack the ship during the night, killing several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering there is no cocaine.          Hockney, a prisoner in one of the cabins, McManus, and then Keaton are killed by an unseen assailant,          who sets fire to the ship as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock.  Kujan deduces that Keaton must be Söze,          as the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming           he could identify Söze. Marquez was being represented by Edie Finneran,            who has also been recently murdered. Kujan claims that the Argentinians took Marquez to sell            him to Söze's Hungarian rivals; Keaton then used the assault so that he could kill Marquez            personally and fake his own death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton had been behind everything,            but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bail is posted and he is released.  Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal had been lying, piecing together details for his story from items posted on a crowded bulletin board in the office, and the \"Kobayashi\" brand on the bottom of the coffee mug Kujan was drinking from.            Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing            his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives from the hospital where Kovash has finally provided a facial composite of Söze, which looks exactly like Verbal. Kujan misses Verbal by moments as the latter disappears into a car driven by \"Kobayashi\".",

    "title": "Premier_League",
    "text": "The Premier League (often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL) outside England) is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its inception, making it a cross-border league.      The competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football      League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television      rights deal. The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the      domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.      The league generates €2.2 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.      In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1.6 billion, rising sharply to £2.4 billion in 2016–17.      The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a      potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. In the 2014–15 season, the average Premier League      match attendance exceeded 36,000, second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga's 43,500.      Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.      The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, as of 2018. Forty-nine clubs have competed       since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. Six of them have won the title since then:       Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Manchester City (3),       Blackburn Rovers (1), and Leicester City (1). The record of most points in a Premier       League season is 100 by Manchester City in 2017–18. From 1993 to 2016, the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies, which were Carling brewery and Barclays Bank PLC; Barclays was the most recent title sponsor, having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 until 2016 (until 2004, the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004). Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues",

    "text": "Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ, is an American former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\" Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. He is currently the principal owner and chairman of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"three-peat\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season, and started a new career in Minor League Baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.\",      Jordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine Mickael. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\". It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $209 million in 2018), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.  In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, to build a 56,000 square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in 2012. His two sons attended Loyola Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school located in Wilmette, Illinois. Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the University of Illinois. After two seasons, Jeffrey left the Illinois basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third season, then received a release to transfer to the University of Central Florida, where Marcus was attending. Marcus transferred to Whitney Young High School after his sophomore year at Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009, and played three seasons of basketball for the school. Jordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played Division I basketball at UNC Greensboro.  On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991.  A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.  He proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.",

Kitchen:  It is very tasty and the prices are acceptable. We had a lot of taverns nearby, but we decided that we wouldn't eat as tasty anywhere as in a hotel. This is unprecedented! Dinners prepared especially for us - not listed in the menu! Special gluten-free meals are prepared for the wife.    Hotel room:  Very tall and tastefully decorated. It is cleaned daily. Comfortable beds.  The only minor drawback was the lack of integrated window ventilators, which made it possible to feel the moisture after bathing.    Internet:  Very fast and trouble-free hotel internet. Very good wi-fi.    Staff:  Excellent. Everyone. In the kitchen, in the restaurant, in the bar, the cleaning lady. . . Everyone wants to help you and make your stay even better. People are the great advantage of this hotel.    Area:  Well... it is the middle of the Greek city. If you expect a beach, it's not here (...it's not far away either), but if you want to have an excellent starting point for exploring the city, all the attractions, etc. - this is the place.

During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.",

    "text": "Matlab is faster than Python in many perspective and overall the performance depends. Python is strictly a programming language but Matlab maybe classified as a tool rather than strictly being a programming language in itself. As the name suggests Matlab is more based on solving mathematical operations. Matlab and Python, both are just derived from primitive hard-code programming language like C and Fortran. Both languages are based on solving operations involving matrix operations. But MatLab can be seen a bit faster due to the involvement of certain packages in Python which adds an extra step to the solving of the problem. Python mostly solves all mathematical problems involving packages like Numpy and scipy for numerical python computation and scientific python computation respectively. But hence the question revolves around the fact of the usage of the two programming tools for data science and Machine Learning; clearly Python stands out due to its flexibility, relevant modules and package availability and it's popularity. But Matlab lacks a good open source environment and is difficult to operate when the data can't be represented in the form of matrices. Matlab flaunts an amazing array of developer tools including IDEs (Integrated Development Environment), plug-ins, dev/build/deployment, etc. Though it has a machine learning library called MKL which is mostly used as mostly all Machine learning functions and algorithms are matrix functions and Matlab also provides the power of image analysis by signal processing, it has solid functions and also enables parallel execution of algorithms. The problem with Matlab being it's quite expensive and weak code portability amongst others. Python helps to improve its speed by using Cython library which integrates CUDA/C capabilities of your Python code making it faster, it's an elegant programming language too. Matlab can be slower in many respects where it fails to understand the data and what kind of library should be deployed for the same. Also when it fails to integrate the data in form of matrix or numerical function values. ",
